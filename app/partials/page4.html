	<p>Chair exercises are an ideal, safe way for our aging residents to get the exercise they need. We want our residents to stay as independent as possible, therefore a regular fitness routine can aid in flexibility, help with balance, increase strength, alleviate pain, and help reduce the occurrence of falls. Although our residents are seated, they still get a full range of movement and conditioning.</p>
